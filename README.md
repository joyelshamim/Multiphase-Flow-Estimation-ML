# Multiphase-Flow-Estimation-ML
Multiphase flow metering – estimation of flow velocities and distribution of component phases using ultrasonic sensors.

# Description
This repository contains the code and data of the project which focuses on multiphase flow metering, utilizing ultrasonic sensors and machine learning techniques to classify flow regimes and estimate flow velocities. Implemented models include image recognition (CNN), regression models, and hybrid classification approaches. The project was conducted in collaboration with SINTEF.

Includes:
✅ Ultrasound data processing (MATLAB & Python)
✅ Machine Learning models (TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn)
✅ Flow regime classification (Deep Learning)
✅ Flow rate prediction (Regression models)
